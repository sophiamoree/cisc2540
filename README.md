the project called "helloGodot" is the submission for lab #1 which contains 2 sprites/images and
a "scene" (some trees...)
- some difficulty i had was trying to adjust the size of everything because i couldnt figure out
  how to seperate the parent node from child, so some of the 'trees' are covering my cat
